# OOP Assignment 1 Solutions
This section contains my solutions for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment 1** from my 2nd Semester (Spring 2024) at **FAST-NUCES**. The assignment covers five real-world scenarios, each designed to reinforce core OOP principles through practical implementation.  

### Core Concepts Implemented
- Class encapsulation with proper access modifiers
- Constructor overloading (default/parameterized)
- Object state management
- Composition relationships
- Input validation and edge case handling

### Scenario Implementations
1. **Virtual Pet System**  
   - Pet health/happiness mechanics
   - Adopter-pet ownership tracking

2. **Table Management**  
   - Dynamic seat allocation (4/8 capacity)
   - State transitions (clean/occupied/dirty)

3. **Chess Engine**  
   - Piece movement validation
   - Board visualization

4. **Roller Coaster Simulator**  
   - Ride state management
   - Capacity validation

5. **Coupon System**  
   - BOGO offer validation
   - Redemption tracking

### Technical Outcomes
- Strengthened OOP design skills
- Improved problem decomposition
- Gained practical experience with:
  - Polymorphism (Chess pieces)
  - Static members (Coupon tracking)
  - State machines (Table/Ride systems)
